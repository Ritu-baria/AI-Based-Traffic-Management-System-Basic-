# 🚦 AI-Based Traffic Management System

An intelligent traffic management system that uses **YOLOv8**, **computer vision**, and **real-time data analysis** to detect traffic density and dynamically control traffic light durations. Designed for smart cities to reduce congestion, save fuel, and improve road efficiency.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional traffic lights follow fixed timers, causing delays during low or high traffic periods. This system solves the problem by using AI to **monitor vehicle density in real-time** and adjust signal timings dynamically, improving overall traffic flow.

## 🎯 Features

- 🚗 Real-time vehicle detection using **YOLOv8**
- 📊 Traffic density estimation
- ⏱️ Dynamic traffic signal timer calculation
- 🖥️ Live interactive dashboard with **Streamlit**
- 📈 Visual statistics of vehicle counts and timing
